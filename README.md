# USE CASE

The project entails a splash screen, login screen and an onboarding screen with 3 sliders
We built this [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) using the [Expo CLI](https://expo.io/) tool.

# How do I get set up?

Just follow steps 1 & 2 to completely set up.

## 1. Get Started

In the project directory, you can run:

### Clone the repo:

\$ `git clone https://github.com/masikotimo/ReactNative-and-Redux.git`

### Navigate to the root folder of the repo:

\$ `cd BITBROTHERSX`

### Install the required dependencies:

\$ `npm install`

## 2. Setup with Expo:

Expo helps you make this game app (React Native) with no build configuration.
It works on macOS, Windows, and Linux.<br/>Refer this link for additional information on [Expo](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/).

If you are new to mobile development, the easiest way to get started is with Expo CLI.<br/>
Expo is a set of tools built around React Native and it can get you started within minutes.

### Expo requirements:

#### Node.js

We recommend the [latest stable version](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), but the maintenance and active LTS releases can also work.

#### Expo client

Expo client is the tool you will use to run your project in development.<br/>
When you serve your project with Expo CLI, it generates a development URL that you can open in Expo client to preview your app.

- **If using a phone,**
  the quickest way to get started is to run the Expo client on your physical iOS or Android device.<br/>
  Expo client for [iOS](https://search.itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZContentLink.woa/wa/link?path=apps%2fexponent) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent) is available. Please note that the minimum Android version is Lollipop (5) and the minimum iOS version is iOS 10.0.

* **If using an emulator,**
  to run the app directly on your computer, you can find the [iOS simulator instructions here](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v35.0.0/workflow/ios-simulator/) and the [Android emulator instructions here](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v35.0.0/workflow/android-studio-emulator/).<br/>
  The iOS simulator only runs on macOS, Android emulators run on any major operating system.

### Install Expo CLI:

\$ `npm install -g expo-cli`

- **Optional: Install Watchman** <br/>
  Some macOS users encounter issues if they do not have Watchman installed on their machine, so if you are using a Mac we recommend that you install it. [Download and install Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html).

### Start the development server:

`npm start`

This will serve the Expo Dev tools on your browser at http://localhost:19002.
The javascript code is bundled and served on port 19001.

### Run the project:

Start the Expo client app on your iOS or Android phone and connect to the same wireless network as your computer.<br/>
On Android, use the Expo app to scan the QR code from your terminal to open your project.<br/>
On iOS, follow on-screen instructions to get a link.

**Congratulations, you are now set.**<br/>
Now, once you make any changes to the project, the app should auto-reload once you save your changes.<br/>
To debug faster, keep checking the Expo Dev tools, Expo client and the terminal concurrently while working on the project.
